You can follow along with a tutorial here: https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/12/19/how-to-use-jwt-authentication-with-django-rest-framework.html

Here's the repo: https://github.com/jazzband/djangorestframework-simplejwt

The URL https://workbookfactory-api.herokuapp.com/api/token/ allows you to login and obtain a token.

To use the browsable API, login here: https://workbookfactory-api.herokuapp.com/api/auth/login/ with the admin credentials you recieved.

With that you can use the browsable API to experiment with what the different views and serializers allow you to do. The APP supports GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, LIST, and DELETE at the moment.

For questions regarding the API, you can take a look at Django Rest Framework.
